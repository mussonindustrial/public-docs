# Embedded View +

This component is an enhancement of the default [Embedded View] component with server-side property mapping.

## Enhancements

This component contains several improvements over the default [Embedded View] component.

### View Parameter Latency

#### Default Component
The default [Embedded View] component passes parameters into its view instance on the client side.
Therefore, in order for bindings to propagate through the component into the view, a websocket send/reply cycle is required between the Perspective client and the gateway.

This cycle can introduce considerable delay for multiple nested embedded views, and clients with high latency will experience especially degraded performance.

#### Server Side Parameter Binding
Instead of passing parameters to the view instance on the client side, the [Embedded View +] component links its own property tree to the view instance property tree though `PropertyTreeSubscriptions`.
These subscriptions operate entirely on the gateway and require no send/reply cycle with the client.

:::info
Parameter changes both in and out of the view instance happen considerably faster than the default component.

#### Parameter Change Latency

The following are expected property transit times for a locally hosted gateway (Perspective client is running on the same machine as the gateway).

| Nested Views | [Embedded View] | [Embedded View +] |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | ~100ms | ~0.220ms |
| 2 | ~200ms | ~0.440ms |
| 3 | ~300ms | ~0.660ms |
| 4 | ~400ms | ~0.880ms |
| 4 | ~500ms | ~1.100ms |

### View Startup Time

#### Default Component
The default [Embedded View] component starts its view instance from the client side.
As a result, bindings on the view instance do not start until the client is already attempting to render the view.

#### Preemptive View Startup
Instead of waiting for the client to request that starting of the view instance, the [Embedded View +] component preemptively starts its view instance during the `ComponentModelDelegate` startup phase.
This gives bindings and scripts a chance to run before the client attempts a render.

:::info
This results in less parameter trashing on startup, where initial values are immediately changed by a binding/script.
