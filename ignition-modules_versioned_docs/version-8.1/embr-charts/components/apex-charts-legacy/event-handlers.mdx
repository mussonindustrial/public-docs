# Event Handlers

ApexCharts provides a range of [event handlers](https://apexcharts.com/docs/options/chart/events/) for their charts. The events allow you to respond to various events, such as mouse click, zoom, selection, etc.

All the events are turned off by default on the component. You can turn them on by setting the event property to true, located in `options.chart.events`.
The following example enables the click event:

```json
{
  "chart": {
    "events": {
      "animationEnd": false,
      "beforeMount": false,
      "mounted": false,
      "updated": false,
      "mouseMove": false,
      "mouseLeave": false,
      "click": true,
      "legendClick": false,
      "markerClick": false,
      "selection": false,
      "dataPointSelection": false,
      "dataPointMouseEnter": false,
      "dataPointMouseLeave": false,
      "beforeZoom": false,
      "beforeResetZoom": false,
      "zoomed": false,
      "scrolled": false,
      "brushScrolled": false
    }
  }
}
```

Once the event is enabled, you can write a corresponding script handler in the components (right-click and select configure events).
All the event handlers have an event object containing details on the event. See the documentation for each event handler for more details.
