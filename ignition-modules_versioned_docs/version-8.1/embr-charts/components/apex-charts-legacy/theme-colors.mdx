# Leveraging Perspective Theme Colors and Fonts

It is possible to leverage Perspective theme colors and fonts for the charts. Simply use a defined variable from the theme in replace of the actual color or font. Here is an example of using a theme color:

```json
{
  "colors": [
    "var(--div-1)",
    "var(--qual-5)"
  ]
}
```
